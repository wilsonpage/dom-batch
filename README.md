# fastdom [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wilsonpage/fastdom.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wilsonpage/fastdom)

Eliminates layout thrashing by batching DOM read/write operations (~750 bytes gzipped).

```js
fastdom.measure(function() {
  console.log('read');
});

fastdom.mutate(function() {
  console.log('write');
});

fastdom.measure(function() {
  console.log('read');
});

fastdom.mutate(function() {
  console.log('write');
});
```

Outputs:

```
read
read
write
write
```

## Installation

FastDom is CommonJS and AMD compatible, you can install it in one of the following ways:

``` sh
$ npm install fastdom
```
``` sh
$ bower install fastdom
```
``` sh
$ component install wilsonpage/fastdom
```
or [download](http://github.com/wilsonpage/fastdom/raw/master/index.js).

## How it works

FastDom works as a regulatory layer between your app/library and the DOM. By batching DOM access we **avoid unnecessary document reflows and speed up layout perfomance dramatically**.

Each measure/mutate job is added to a corresponding measure/mutate queue. The queues are emptied (reads, then writes) at the turn of the next frame using [`window.requestAnimationFrame`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.requestAnimationFrame).

FastDom aims to behave like a singleton across *all* modules in your app. When any module requires `'fastdom'` they  get the same instance back, meaning FastDom can harmonize DOM access app-wide.

Potentially a third-party library could depend on FastDom, and better integrate within an app that itself uses it.

## API

### FastDom#measure(callback[, context])

Schedules a job for the 'measure' queue. Returns a unique ID that can be used to clear the scheduled job. Normally this is only needed if called inside of a 'mutate' function.

```js
fastdom.measure(function() {
  var width = element.clientWidth;
});
```

### FastDom#mutate(callback[, context])

Schedules a job for the 'mutate' queue. Returns a unique ID that can be used to clear the scheduled job.

```js
fastdom.mutate(function() {
  element.style.width = width + 'px';
});
```

### FastDom#clear(id)

Clears **any** scheduled job.

```js
var read = fastdom.measure(function(){});
var write = fastdom.mutate(function(){});
var defer = fastdom.defer(4, function(){});

fastdom.clear(read);
fastdom.clear(write);
fastdom.clear(defer);
```

## Exceptions

FastDom is async, this can therefore mean that when a job comes around to being executed, the node you were working with may no longer be there. These errors are usually not critical, but they can cripple your app.

FastDom allows you to register an `catch` handler. If `fastdom.catch` has been registered, FastDom will catch any errors that occur in your jobs, and run the handler instead.

```js
fastdom.catch = function(error) {
  // Do something if you want
};

```

## Tests

#### With PhantomJS

``` sh
$ npm install
$ npm test
```

#### Without PhantomJS

Open `test/index.html` in your browser.
